## Overview

The Structural Analysis Tool is a web application designed to assist engineers and students in visualizing and analyzing the behavior of beams under various loads. It provides insights into key structural properties and diagrams, allowing users to make informed design decisions. This tool is built using Streamlit and Matplotlib for visualization.

## Features

- **Beam Visualization:** Visualize the beam and the applied load.
- **Shear Force Diagram (SFD):** Understand the distribution of shear forces along the beam.
- **Bending Moment Diagram (BMD):** Visualize the bending moments acting on the beam.
- **Deflected Shape Diagram (DSD):** See the deflected shape of the beam under the applied load.
- **Axial Force Diagram (AFD):** Understand the distribution of axial forces in columns.
